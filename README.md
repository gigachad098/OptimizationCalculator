This is a very early stage of my 2022 Christmas break personal project. My goal is to make an AI model that detects target functions inside word problems for Calculus 1 level optimization.
Eventually I want to turn this into a discord bot and maybe even add support for basic related rates problems.
My current focus is on building the differentiation class for the project.
